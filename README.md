The material taught in this workshop is based on Ruan's own experience with the R-packages [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) and [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), and general tidy-data-science principles he learnt from from [R for Data Science, by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
